# Smart_Farming_Agentic_AI
This AI agent provide small-scale farmers with real-time, localized agricultural advice.  It is made by using Ibm cloud free services.

The proposed system is an AI agent for smart farming advice that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This agent will provide real-time, localized guidance to small-scale farmers. The solution will retrieve trusted data from various sources, including agricultural departments, meteorological services, and agri-tech platforms. Farmers will be able to interact with the agent in their local language, asking questions such as "What crop is best for this season?" or "What is today's mandi rate for tomatoes?".The solution will consist of the following components:
Data Collection:
Gather trusted data on weather forecasts, soil conditions, crop recommendations, pest control measures, and current market prices.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle inconsistencies and missing values.
Machine Learning Algorithm:
Implement an machine learning model llama-3-3-70-instruct that can understand and respond to farmer queries in their local language. The system will use the retrieved data to generate accurate and relevant advice.
Deployment:
Develop a user-friendly interface or application for farmers to interact with the agent. The solution will be deployed on a scalable platform to ensure reliability and accessibility.
Evaluation:
Assess the agent's effectiveness and accuracy in providing helpful advice.
